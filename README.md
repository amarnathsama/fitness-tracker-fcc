# [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker)
Another one from FCC, the authetication of projects is really buggy on the site, so i couldn't get this one or the one before to be accepted but still happy, I tested this and it works, so that feels great.
Another thing is that it seems to me that using designated functions instead of basic loops is the common practice, I guess it make the code less bulky and also makes it readable, but I haven't used that approach in this, so if the code looks confusing or too long, you know why!
